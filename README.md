# Blood_Donation_App

When it counts most, people count on the blood to always be available.
Volunteer blood donors are the main source of supply in a well-managed blood supply chain.
Through their donations, they support the blood supply. 
If there are not enough blood supplies available in an emergency, voluntary blood donations from visitors to the health center will be the only source of blood supply. 
Time is without a doubt a crucial factor in this case.
To guarantee that the service is provided as soon as feasible, the health care facility should call the nearest available donor.
In emergency cases where blood cannot be given through the blood banks' supply, a smart phone application is created to make it easier to locate the closest available blood donor volunteer and communicate with him or her.
This application will be discussed in this File.

USED TOOLS:

Flutter:

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google.
It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. 
I used flutter because it gives best UI design quick and easily.

Flutter consists of two important parts:

An SDK (Software Development Kit): A collection of tools that are going to help you develop your applications.
This includes tools to compile your code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android).
A Framework (UI Library based on widgets): A collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) that you can personalize for your own needs.

Node.js:

I used Node.js for backend. Node.js (Node) is an open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side.
Node is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection from the browser to the server and is often used for real-time applications such as chat, news feeds and web push notifications.

MongoDB:

MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.
